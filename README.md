# brotips

While I was in highschool (circa 2009-2013), these quotes circulated
the social media platforms. I originally wrote an Android app to
display them (which search, saving as favorites, and sharing functionality)
-- but they've since disappeared slowly from the internet.

I built this pretty quickly to simply resurrect and provide a way
for them to live on (in some fashion).

## Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                | Action                                           |
| :--------------------- | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`          | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`          | Starts local dev server at `localhost:3000`      |
| `npm run build`        | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`      | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
